# WorldWise Web Application

Simple web app that allows users to keep track of the places they've visited. Built to highlight routing, the react context API as well as the leaflet library.

Project based on [The Ultimate React Course 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` to install all needed dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install
```

The API is simulated by a JSON file in the data folder running on `json-server`. You can change the port on the `package.json` file by changing the `--port` flag value.

```bash
$ npm run server

# on another terminal instance
$ npm run start
```
